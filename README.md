Q11. Was Shipping Cost Appropriately Aligned with Order Priority?
üö© Analysis:
Despite Delivery Truck being the most economical, many Low and Medium priority orders were shipped via Express Air‚Äîthe most expensive mode.
Order Priority	Ship Mode	Order Count	Est. Shipping Cost	Avg Duration
Critical	Express Air	140	‚Ç¶133,534.96	1 day
Low	Express Air	139	‚Ç¶134,323.44	4 days
Medium	Express Air	129	‚Ç¶159,498.47	1 day
üìå Conclusion:
‚ùå No, shipping was not appropriately aligned.
Low-priority orders used fast, costly shipping unnecessarily.
High-priority orders sometimes used slower methods.
Order delivery time remained mostly 1 day across modes, negating Express Air's benefits.

üìå Final Recommendations
1.	Align shipping mode with order priority to reduce unnecessary costs.
2.	Identify and renegotiate with customers who consistently yield negative profits.
3.	Build a profitability dashboard to monitor real-time order margins.
4.	Audit logistics partners and incentivize cost-effective deliveries.
5.	Expand in top-performing regions (e.g., West, Ontario) while managing cost in low-performing areas.
